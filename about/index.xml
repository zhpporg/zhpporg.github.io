      <description>We found ZHPP during a time of need. We&#39;d just moved to Wilton, and while our son&#39;s birthdate qualified him for kindergarten, he needed more time to build skills, confidence, and socialization. Enter ZHPP! We enrolled him in the 5&#39;s class and it was the best decision we could have made. Our son is now a thriving first grader. ZHPP is an amazing community, devoted to each and every child.</description>
