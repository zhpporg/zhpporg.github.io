      <description>Welcome letter On behalf of the Board of Directors, welcome to Zion’s Hill Preschool Program! The board is a group of dedicated parent volunteers who use their skills, talents, and experience to make Zion’s Hill the best preschool that it can be. Parents join the Board for various reasons – to be more involved in the school’s community, to better understand their child’s pre-school education, to give back to the school for all it does for their kids, etc.</description>

      <description>Part of what makes the community here at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program so special and unique are the families, local businesses, and groups volunteering their time and various services.
These contributions help create the foundation of what our program is all about. They illustrate the generosity present here at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program.
We would like to take a moment to extend a warm “thank you” to you.
We are grateful for each of your generous contributions throughout the school year here at ZHPP.</description>
