      <description>Welcome letter On behalf of the Board of Directors, welcome to Zion’s Hill Preschool Program! The board is a group of dedicated parent volunteers who use their skills, talents, and experience to make Zion’s Hill the best preschool that it can be. Parents join the Board for various reasons – to be more involved in the school’s community, to better understand their child’s pre-school education, to give back to the school for all it does for their kids, etc.</description>

      <description>We found ZHPP during a time of need. We&amp;rsquo;d just moved to Wilton, and while our son&amp;rsquo;s birthdate qualified him for kindergarten, he needed more time to build skills, confidence, and socialization. Enter ZHPP! We enrolled him in the 5&amp;rsquo;s class and it was the best decision we could have made. Our son is now a thriving first grader. ZHPP is an amazing community, devoted to each and every child.</description>
