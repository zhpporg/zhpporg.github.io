      <description>They came with diplomas. They came with cookies and cameras. They came with a big banner and binders full of art. And they came with a bridge. A five-foot-long arched wooden bridge.
With schools closed, and current guidelines limiting indoor gatherings to 10 and outdoor events to 25, the usual graduation plans are abandoned everywhere. Planning committees are finding ways to honor 2020’s high school and college graduates with pre-recorded speeches and Zoom calls and yard signs.</description>

      <description>Treat Yourself Right Dear Families,
Happy May! Let’s hope that April showers bring May flowers—and with it some warmer temperatures, a flattening of the COVID curve or better yet a vaccine, and some return to normalcy! These are trying times. I am finding the uncertainty particularly difficult to grasp: how long will social distancing—as necessary as it is—last? When can our school/town/state/country/world safely reopen? Will summer camp proceed?
These questions weigh heavily, as many have been suddenly thrust into roles we never envisioned (home school headmaster, short order cook, closet organizer, peacekeeper, internet troubleshooter).</description>

      <description>Dear Families,
Well, as you might have guessed, this is an unusual newsletter, brought to you at this most unusual time. It is hard to believe that we were all together just over two weeks ago, and that our daily lives have changed so dramatically in such a short period of time. Who would have thought that I would miss my family’s harried morning rush to get to the bus and school on time, or juggling our activities and (gasp!</description>

      <description>Happy March!
Dear Families,
The third month of the year is upon us—or is it? Fun fact: the ancient Roman calendar included just ten months, beginning with March and ending with December. In many ways, March brings new beginnings as we say goodbye to winter and hello to spring. The days grow longer, the sun shines brighter, icy patches melt to muddy puddles, and plants push their way through newly thawed ground.</description>

      <description>Dear Families,
Happy February! Winter may have been slow to arrive, but we finally have some SNOW! The children are enamored—they enjoy watching snowflakes fall outside the classroom windows, decorating the snowmen and snowflakes that brighten our halls, and, best of all, playing outdoors in the snow! The winter playgrounds provide an entirely different environment for the children to cooperatively explore. They love it! We hope you, too, will enjoy the snow.</description>

      <description>Perhaps your child’s birthday falls in the second half of the year. Maybe you’re thinking your child needs more social and emotional growth. Or you sense that your child would benefit from additional play-based learning before enrolling in kindergarten. Whatever the reason, you might be wondering, why the Five’s?
On January 15, a panel of staff, parents, and an education specialist, convened at Zion’s Hill Preschool to answer that question. Director Jessica Joy opened the event by providing some context.</description>

      <description>Dear Families,
Happy New Year!
I hope this finds you enjoying the holiday break with opportunities for both relaxation and merriment with your loved ones. January is the perfect time to pause, take stock, and set goals for the year ahead. While we adults may see the New Year as a chance to test old patterns or try something new, the children will be settling into the comfort of school routines.</description>

      <title>Endless Play—and Possibilities!—with Dough</title>

      <description>Making play dough is one of our favorite activities at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program … for children and teachers alike! But did you know that the original Play-Doh® was first made as a wallpaper cleaner in the 1930s? Upon learning that young children found modeling clay too difficult to manipulate, the manufacturer sent some of the pliable cleaning material to local schools in Cincinnati. Word quickly spread: the product was showcased at an education convention in 1955, and a year later, Play-Doh® was born.</description>

      <description>Happy Holidays! Dear Families,
Say it isn’t so … is December nearly here? Time sure flies when you’re having fun, and we’ve certainly been having a lot of fun!
A highlight in November was the horse-drawn carriage. Over the wee hill and through the lot, to the church did we all go! I even got to ride with the children, a real treat. We celebrated our annual Thanksgiving Feast with our Four’s and Five’s families, a perennial favorite.</description>

      <title>How do children gain writing skills through play?</title>

      <description>One of the most common questions I receive from prospective parents about our play-based program is, “How do children learn if they are playing all day?” It’s a fair question. As adults, we know how to read, write, add, and subtract, but we may have no recollection of how we learned these things. I certainly don’t! It’s very difficult to put ourselves back in the mindset of a child, to really understand what children experience as they learn.</description>

      <description>Grateful in November Dear Families,
As October ends, we officially close the book on “back to school” mode, which culminated in our Fall Family Fun Day and Parent Open House. We loved seeing so many of you and showcasing our school. Picture Day has also come and gone—we can’t wait for you to see the happy, adorable faces! The children have adjusted to their classroom environments and are enjoying all of the “extras” ZHPP provides, from singing and downward-dogging with Miss JoAnne, to learning Spanish with Señora Vicky, to climbing on fire trucks during Fire Prevention Week.</description>

      <description>Happy Fall! Dear Families,
The school year is in full swing, and such fun fall will bring! The children have settled in beautifully to their classrooms and routines, and the staff and I have loved getting to know each of them—and you too! It is so heartwarming to see friendships forming, and the halls and classrooms once again filled with the children’s artwork and proud evidence of their learning (just a glimpse of what you will hear about at Open House!</description>

Welcome to the 2019–2020 school year (our 47th year) at Zion’s Hill Preschool Program! We hope everyone had an amazingly memorable summer and we are excited to hear about your adventures.
The teachers and staff can’t wait to greet you on the playgrounds Tuesday and Wednesday, August 27 and 28. We’ve missed you so! Meet the Teacher Days will be followed by Orientation on Thursday and Friday, when we will share information about the classroom, curriculum, and daily routines.</description>

      <description>Happy Summer! Dear Parents,
It’s hard to believe we are in the home stretch, heading toward the finish line of another wonderful year at ZHPP! And speaking of finish line, how great was the Mini-Marathon?!?!? The children loved it and the special annual tradition allowed us to see how much growth – both physically and developmentally – has transpired this year. Year-end brings the perfect opportunity to celebrate our little learners, but it is bittersweet too.</description>

      <description>Dear Families,
It is certainly invigorating to see the green grass and daffodils (and even the dandelions) popping out of the moist soil — such a lush and welcomed sight. A special thank you to those who helped spruce up the playgrounds and yards at Spring Clean-up — everything looks great! The children love the outdoor spaces and are easily energized by fresh air and exercise… with special Zion’s Hill traditions in May they will have plenty of both!</description>

      <description>Knock, Knock
Who’s there?
Owls say
Owls say who?
Yes, they do.
Hee hee! No fooling, April is upon us – another month filled with laughter and fun! March was magical in its own right, with the first and only real snowfall of the year, and a special visit from Woodcock Nature Center. While Mr. Sam did not bring an owl, it was amazing to watch the wonder on the children’s faces as he presented his cast of characters… whether it was Chubbs (probably the biggest frog they had ever seen), Squirt the baby turtle, or the sticky-footed tree frog, they were totally delighted!</description>

      <description>Looking Forward to Spring! Dear Families,
Happy March! This proverbial “In Like a Lion, Out Like a Lamb” month is filled with lots of changes and transformations as we say goodbye to winter and hello to spring…. the days grow longer, the sun shines brighter, icy patches melt to muddy puddles, and winter coats are replaced with lighter jackets. March is also metaphoric for the changes and transformations that the children have experienced since September… some back-to-school jitters have given way to smiles and laughter, they all have grown a little taller, expanded their vocabulary and friendships, and have their daily school routines down pat.</description>

      <description>Celebrations of Love! Dear Parents,
Happy February! The slow start to winter, with many sunny days, has helped everyone adjust to the colder temps, and the SNOW!! Despite the work involved donning winter gear, it’s always worth it and great for the kids to get fresh air! They love it, and find the playgrounds provide an entirely different environment in which to explore and cooperatively discover.
Indoors, we are gallivanting along with our wonderfully planned schedules and routines, along with some extra fun.</description>

      <description>Dear Parents,
We hope this finds you well-satiated with food, drink, family and friends. January is a great time to hit the reset button – earlier bed times, house decluttering, and of course the infamous New Year’s resolutions to reverse holiday indulgences. It can be both motivating and invigorating to step outside our comfort zones and try something different; better yet, to encourage others along the way … Our talented teachers are proof positive of this as they gently guide the children along their learning journey.</description>

      <description>Happy Holidays Dear Parents,
The view from our shared desk continues to be a roly, poly, smooth and exhilarating ride! So much diversity in a day, a week, the last month. Quiet times find us engaging with the kids in their classrooms, giving a tour and fine-tuning schedules. Busy times find us loading children onto a horse-drawn carriage for a hay ride, singing and dancing along with Miss Jo Anne and as always, working on communications with the staff, students and parents.</description>

The school year is off to a great start! The children have had a smooth transition into their new classrooms and for many, into their new school as well. The teachers are having so much fun getting to know each and every one of them through home visits and classroom interactions. I was able to spend time in each of the classrooms and enjoyed all of the conversations with your little ones.</description>
